Add items from search to list DONE
    side by side DONE
    drag and drop DONE
make search button fire when hitting enter
mark item purchased (cross off)
remove item from list
Allow creation of custom items
Create separate lists for different people
Add link to item display
Save the list to localstorage so it remains when you return
totals
    list total
    person total
Actually style item display so it looks good
    search will be hidden to start
    will come in from the side, moving everything to fit like the menu bar I created previously
Error handling
    no blank searches
    validate input on custom items

maybe:
add a basic password; it would have to be stored in localstorage, to prevent other people around the house from accessing the list.
